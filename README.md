## Mouse Simulator


</div>

### Description

This program simulates mouse events. It can, left click, right click, pause between events, and you can easily make it double click too. It works by using an action list (listbox), the user inputs a bunch of actions that they want to perform, then the program does all the actions in the list for a specified amount of loops. (you can also specify the cursor position for each action, i.e. click on start menu, then click run.)
 
### More Info
 
there are only a couple of bugs, nothing big. It still works fully. You can't have the loop value null however, sorry, didn't fix it, it should be pretty easy just use a val() function.
